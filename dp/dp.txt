multiple calls in recursion
optimal solution asked (min, max, largest, etc.)
Find number of ways also popular dp problem
choice given whether to include or not

Memoization -: Top-Down, starting from end
Tabulation -: Bottom-Up, starting from start

For base condition take smallest valid input

Without Recursion
make dp table, first row and first column are for initialization (because they contain smallest input for example base condition n == 0 or w == 0 return 4, so first column w = 0, first row n = 0 filled with 4)
then just writing like recursion, also index of arrays are 1 less than i j (index of dp)

sometimes can optimize inner loop by sorting or break

when using xor start with b = 0
and also set initial conditions, for i = 0 and j = 0

in mcm for base think for invalid input
for mcm recursion is better as 3 variables
first set i j
then base

mcm also has o(n*n) solution but not valid in variations
// i pe cut matlab ith ke bad cut

2 conditions ans when both true, find first if first true then find second

if using map for dp, remember to clear
also store values as 
if (dp[{i, j}] != 0){
    return dp[{i, j}] - 1;
}
dp[{i, j}] = ans;
dp[{i, j}] += 1;
return dp[{i, j}] -= 1;

dp like 
map<int, int> dp[101][101];
can't do dp.clear()
loop and reset

see constant thing moving in a line at each i, j, w white and b black, question depends on product may do dp[i][j][w*b]

find the maximum element in the K manhattan distance neighbourhood for all elements in nxm matrix. 
In other words, for every element M[i][j] find the maximum element M[p][q] such that abs(i-p)+abs(j-q) <= K.
in such question get answer for k - 1
